# hkdaemons


A HomeKit bridge that uses [HomeControl](https://github.com/brutella/hc) to
control things such as switches, lights, thermostats via MQTT.

Originally intended for ITEAD Sonoff devices, this has grown to cover various
other microcontrollers and applications.

See [sonoff-mqtt](https://github.com/davea/sonoff-mqtt) for
[MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) scripts to install on the device.
